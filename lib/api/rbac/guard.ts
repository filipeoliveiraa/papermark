/**
 * Lightweight inline guard for team routes that have NOT yet been migrated to
 * the `withTeam` session wrapper. It enforces two invariants for the
 * dataroom-scoped role on top of a route's existing membership check:
 *
 *  1. If `dataroomId` is provided, a scoped member must be assigned to that
 *     room (closes cross-room IDOR for assigned-vs-unassigned rooms).
 *  2. If `dataroomId` is NOT provided (a team-level route), a scoped member is
 *     denied outright (default-deny — these routes are not part of the scoped
 *     surface).
 *
 * Returns `true` if the request was denied (and a response was sent); the
 * caller should `return` immediately. Returns `false` when access is allowed.
 *
 * Non-scoped roles (ADMIN/MANAGER/MEMBER) are never affected by this guard.
